# Steps to start local Development
For ease of working, we have created a common package.json at global level to make sure the same version of packages are used in both backend and frontend, as well as its easier to run commands via the root directory( no need to cd into backend and frontend separately).

- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` in the root directory. Installs node_moduels to both backend and frontend.
- Run `npm run dev` for dev server and `npm run prod` for prod build.
